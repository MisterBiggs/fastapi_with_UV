1 after creating folder 
    command: uv init .

2. our .toml file after that copy and paste in readme

this has three aprt  meta data part
"""

[project]
name = "fastapi"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = []
[project]
name = "fastapi"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = []

"""
3. create 'main.py' (in section where toml is present) location 'C:\Users\xeesh\OneDrive\Desktop\Afnan\AI\fastapi_explore\main.py'

4. in tomml we have only python, we need fast api framework, and uvcorn[standard] 
    it makes our local pc to server to run fastapi, else fastapi is only coding interface
5. add fastapi and uvicorn[standard]  it will be automaticaly add into dependencies in toml, also it will
    install required subpackages in backend too
    command: uv add fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
    command: uv add pytest
    this will bring dependecnis and also add them into toml and also proivde uv.lock 
    see dependecies auto added after we ran command
    [project]
    name = "fastapi_explore"
    version = "0.1.0"
    description = "Add your description here"
    readme = "README.md"
    requires-python = ">=3.13"
    dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.11",
    "pytest>=8.3.5",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.34.0",
]

6.  from fastapi import FastAPI

 
# craeting object of FastAPI class
# this object responsile for everything done from fastapi
# this will be our server , adn right now
app  = FastAPI()

# our decorator function
# decorator "@" is extra 

@app.get("/")# againt api adres  
def index():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

#anyone who route
@app.get("/piaic/")
def piaic():
    return {"organization":"piaic"}

7. afte we did some app ocject work this is how to run server
--reload mean for any chnages in server we dont need to stop it

 command: uvicorn main:app --reload
INFO:     Started server process [10728]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

8. to get specific server service 
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/piaic

9. to check doc .run . and we can check repsonse to this below request from 
            we can check all of our routes
  run this from chrome        127.0.0.1:8000/docs 

10. any api or proejct we work on, we create test for it
    for each function such as 1000 function we write test code for it
    and as soon as we run test_somename.py it will test execute auto 1000 func
    make sure testing funtion has test in its name so we we run pytest it will auot figure it out
    creat test file.
